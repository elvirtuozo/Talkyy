      <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which Talky collects, uses, maintains, and discloses information collected from users (each, a "User") of the Talky mobile application ("App").</p>
      <p>1. Collection of Personal Identification Information
      Talky may collect personal identification information from Users during the registration process. This information may include the User's nationality, age, and gender. The purpose of collecting this information is to create a dataset to help improve the accuracy and functionality of Talky's artificial intelligence (AI) model.

Collection of Audio Recordings
Talky may collect audio recordings of Users pronouncing Arabic words. These recordings are used to improve the pronunciation and language learning features within the App. The audio recordings are securely stored on our servers and are associated with the User's account.

Data Usage and Processing
The personal identification information and audio recordings collected by Talky are used solely for the purpose of enhancing the user experience and improving the AI model's accuracy. The collected data is anonymized and aggregated to create a dataset that helps train and optimize the AI model. This dataset is not deployed within the App itself but used separately in an offline environment.

Data Sharing
Talky does not sell, trade, or rent Users' personal identification information or audio recordings to third parties. However, we may share anonymized and aggregated data with trusted partners and affiliates for research, analysis, or other purposes that contribute to improving Talky's services. Any shared data will be stripped of personally identifiable information.

Data Retention
Talky retains the personal identification information and audio recordings for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. Users may request the deletion of their data by contacting us through the provided contact details.

Data Security
Talky takes reasonable measures to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and security of Users' personal information and audio recordings. We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to safeguard against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of personal data.

Third-Party Services
Talky may use third-party services, such as cloud storage providers, for data storage and processing purposes. These third-party providers are selected based on their reputation and commitment to data security and privacy. However, Talky is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of these third-party services.
